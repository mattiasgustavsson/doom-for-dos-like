# doom-for-dos-like
This is a quick but fairly complete version of the original DOOM ported to 
the [dos-like framework](https://github.com/mattiasgustavsson/dos-like).
The data included is for original DOOM shareware version.

It can be built as a Windows executable or as WebAssembly to run in a browser.
I have not tried running it for Linux or Mac, but the code builds at least.

You can try the web version at https://mattiasgustavsson.com/wasm/doom
